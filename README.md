# deeplearning-demos
Deep learning demos using MNIST data set with multiple neural network models

To run the model, simply choose the model first:
---------
1. 1_MLP.py
2. 2_CNN_Failed.py
3. 3_CNN.py
4. 4_GRU_RNN.py
5. 5_Auto_Encoder.py

Then, run the following code:
 ```bash
 python3 [model]
 ```
 For example,
 ```bash
 python3 1_MLP.py
 ```
