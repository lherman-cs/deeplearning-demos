# deeplearning-demos
Deep learning demos using the MNIST data set with multiple neural network models.

To run the model:
---------
Simply choose the model first:
* 1_MLP.py
* 2_CNN_Failed.py
* 3_CNN.py
* 4_GRU_RNN.py
* 5_Auto_Encoder.py

Then, run the following code:
 ```bash
 python3 [model]
 ```
 For example,
 ```bash
 python3 1_MLP.py
 ```
